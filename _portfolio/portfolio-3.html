Ovarian cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, making diagnosis and treatment challenging.
Traditional histopathology analysis has limitations due to subjectivity and inter-observer variability.
This study presents the OvarianAttentionClassifier, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a spatial attention mechanism designed for 
precise ovarian cancer subtyping from digital histopathology images. The research introduces novel class balancing techniques using stain 
augmentation and normalization to enhance model robustness. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 92%, precision of 0.9351, recall of 0.9357,
F1 score of 0.9350, and AUC of 0.9906, significantly outperforming conventional diagnostic methods.
