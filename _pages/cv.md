Education
======
* Batchlors in Computer Science and Information Technology with Honors, Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, India, 2024
* Diploma in Computer Engineering, Cusrow Wadia Institute of Technology, Pune, 2021

Work experience
======

* July 2025 - Present: Junior Research Fellow, JISIASR
  * Working on EEG-based machine learning models to develop neuro-biomarkers that can differentiate between Virtual Autism
and Actual Autism.
  * Collaborating with the Institute of Neurosciences, Kolkata for clinical data collection and validation.
  * The project is funded by the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), Government of India. 
  * Supervisor: Dr. Kasturi Barik (Ph. D. IIT Kharagpur)

* Jan 2025 - June 2025: Data Scientist, Core AI
  * In my previous role as a Data Scientist, I worked with 3D MRI images of Alzheimer’s patients, along with longitudinal
    data acquired from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
  * Analyzed longitudinal data to identify patterns and track disease progression, helping detect patient variations early for
    timely intervention.
  * Developed models that integrated MRI and textual data to diagnose patients based on plasma-based biomarkers 
  * Supervisor: Dr. Sidharth Pancholi

* Jan 2024-July 2024: Research Assistant 
  * Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, India
  * Collaborated with Dr. V. H. Kalmani on a research project focused on applying vision transformers for the segmentation
of kidney blood vessels in HIP CT scans.
  * Developed algorithms and scripts to generate 3D reconstructions of blood vessel networks from CT scan images, allowing
for detailed anatomical study and quantitative analysis
  * Developed a novel hybrid loss function for kidney blood vessel segmentation. Combined Log Cosh Dice loss and Binary
    Cross Entropy. Achieved state-of-the-art performance with Dice coefficient of 0.9308.

* Oct 2023− Jan 2024: Computer Vision Intern, Cognautica
  * Interning at Cognautica a startup based in San Francisco, I actively contribute to the development of an AI grader system
for U.S. schools, with a primary focus on refining OCR accuracy for paper PDFs.
  * Integrated LaTeX OCR pipeline to convert images of equations to latex code readable to LLM.
