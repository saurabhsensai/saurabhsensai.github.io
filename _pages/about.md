I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology degree with Honours from [Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, Islampur](https://www.ritindia.edu/ritwebsite/website/index.php) and a Computer Engineering diploma from [Cusrow Wadia Institute of Technology, Pune](https://cwit.mespune.org/). 

Currently, I am a Junior Research Fellow at JIS Institute of Advanced Studies & Research, where I am working on EEG-based machine learning models to develop neuro-biomarkers that can differentiate between Virtual Autism and Actual Autism. We are collaborating with the Institute of Neurosciences, Kolkata for clinical data collection and validation.. This project is funded by the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), Government of India. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Core AI, where I focus on 3D MRI processing and classification, specifically working on Alzheimer’s disease detection. My work involves developing advanced deep learning models to analyze brain MRI scans, contributing to early diagnosis and progression tracking of neurodegenerative disorders. Before that, I worked at RIT Islampur, where I applied vision transformers for kidney blood vessel segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance. I have also interned at Cognautica SF, improving OCR accuracy for AI grading systems, and at IITD-AIA Foundation, where I contributed to computer vision-based defect detection in 3D-printed parts.

Beyond research and development, I have demonstrated leadership as the Vice President and AI/ML Lead of Google DSC at RIT Islampur and as the President of IUCEE EWB (Engineers Without Borders).

I am also passionate about teaching and enjoy sharing knowledge through YouTube videos and written tutorials on various topics. By creating educational content, I aim to make complex AI and machine learning concepts more accessible to a wider audience
